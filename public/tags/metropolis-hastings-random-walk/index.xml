      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 2 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on wildlife strikes with aircraft. The aim was to predict whether or not the aircraft was damaged in the collision.
My approach: The database was created by the FAA from reports filed by pilots that are clearly incomplete. For my previous post, I spent the vast majority of the time cleaning the data and afterwards used a logistic regression model.</description>
