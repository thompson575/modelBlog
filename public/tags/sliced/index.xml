      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 2 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on wildlife strikes with aircraft. The aim was to predict whether or not the aircraft was damaged in the collision.
My approach: The original database was created by the FAA from reports filed by pilots and reporting is clearly incomplete. I spent the vast majority of my time cleaning the data and afterwards used a logistic regression model.</description>

      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the games’ ratings.
My approach: In the data exploration I transform the ratings and plot them against the potential predictors. I note inconsistencies in the data. The mechanics of the game and the type of game are described as text, so I create indicator variables for the words most closely associated with the games’ ratings.</description>

      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 3 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on superstore sales. The aim was to predict the profit on each sale.
My approach: This is a good example of a problem for which we have knowledge about the structure of the data. In particular, we know the relation between sales, cost, discount and profit.</description>
