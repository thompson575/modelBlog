      <description>IntroductionSliced is a data science competition hosted by Nick Wan and Meg Risdal on twitch ( https://www.twitch.tv/nickwan_datasci ). In each episode, 4 data scientists with very different backgrounds are given the same dataset and in 2 hours they must explore the data and build a predictive model. As well as the training data, they are given a test set that lacks the variable to be predicted. The model that best predicts in the test data according to a specified metric, wins the prediction element of the competition, but other points are available for data visualization, golden features and popularity as voted for by chat.</description>
