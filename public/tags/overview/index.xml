      <description>IntroductionSliced is a data science competition hosted by Nick Wan on twitch. In each episode, 4 data scientists with a wide range of experience and very different backgrounds are given the same dataset and in 2 hours they must visualize the data and build a predictive model. As well as the training data, there is always a test data set which lacks the variable that is to be predicted.</description>
