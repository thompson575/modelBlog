      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 11 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on properties in the Austin area that were advertised on Zillow. The aim was to predict the house price, lumped into 5 categories.
My approach: I decided to use these data to illustrate the use of pipelines in mlr3. I identify commonly used words from the estate agents description of the property and use a pipeline to filter them and combine the selected keywords with the numerical descriptors of the property.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIâ€™ll use the Boardgame Rating data from episode 1 of Sliced to illustrate the use of mlr3 for pre-processing. The challenge for that episode is to predict the scores given to boardgames by the boardgamegeek website (https://boardgamegeek.com/) using predictors that describe the game.
This post is a continuation of Methods: Introduction to mlr3. If you are new to mlr3 you ought to start with that earlier post.</description>
