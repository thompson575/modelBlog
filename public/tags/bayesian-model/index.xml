      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the gamesâ€™ ratings.
My approach: In an earlier post entitled Sliced Episode 1: Boardgame Ratings, I analysed these data using traditional methods. That post describes my data cleaning, feature selection and data exploration. In this analysis, I take those same cleaned data and analyse them using a Bayesian model.</description>
