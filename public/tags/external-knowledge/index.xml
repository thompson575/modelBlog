      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 3 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on superstore sales. The aim was to predict the profit on a sale.
My approach: This is a good example of a problem for which we have knowledge about the structure of the data. In particular, we know the relation between sales, cost, discount and profit.</description>
