      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 9 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on baseball. The aim was to predict whether or not a hit went for a home run.
My approach: I ran an extensive exploratory analysis relating the percentage of home runs to each of the exploratory factors. The type of hit is extremely predictive; for instance, you cannot hit a home run off a ground ball.</description>
