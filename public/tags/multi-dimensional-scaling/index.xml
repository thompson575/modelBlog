      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 7 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on bank customers. The aim was to predict whether a customer would churn (leave the bank).
My approach: I started with the idea that people churn for different reasons and because of this, it will be difficult to find a single scale that distinguishes churners from non-churners.</description>
