      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the games’ ratings.
My approach: In the data exploration I transform the ratings and plot them against the potential predictors. I note inconsistencies in the data. The mechanics of the game and the type of game are described as text, so I create indicator variables for the words most closely associated with the games’ ratings.</description>
