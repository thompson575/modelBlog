      <description>Workflow managementMakefiles are a way of controlling large programming projects. Complex software is typically organised into multiple files of code. Each file requires compilation before the object files are linked together with pre-compiled libraries to create the final executable. When a change is made to one section of the code, it is important to recompile everything affected by that change, but not the code files that are unaffected. A makefile contains a list of all of the code files and libraries together with a set of rules that determine when re-compilation will be needed.</description>
