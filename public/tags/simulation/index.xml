      <description>fileArchiveIn the post entitled ‘My Evolving Workflow’, I discussed various ways in which my data analysis workflow has changed since I started this blog in 2021. It this post, I elaborate on one of those changes namely the way in which I now archive files of results.
fileArchive is my own package for archiving files. It fits well with my current workflow, but I have made no attempt to extend it to have wider use.</description>
