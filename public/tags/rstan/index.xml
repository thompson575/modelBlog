      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 3 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on superstore sales. The aim was to predict the profit on each sale in the test set.
My approach: I start with the model used in my non-Bayesian analysis of these data, which transformed the profit to the profit that would have been obtained had there not been a discount.</description>

      <description>IntroductionProbabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) provide a way of specifying a Bayesian model and a choice of samplers that can be used to simulate parameter values from the model’s joint posterior. The Wikipedia page on Probabilitic Programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming) lists about 40 such languages, of which a handful can be run in, or via, R.
As the name suggests, BUGS (Bayesian Inference using Gibbs Sampling) is a PPL that uses Gibbs sampling.</description>
