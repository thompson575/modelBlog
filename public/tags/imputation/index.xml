      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 4 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on daily weather patterns in different parts of Australia. The aim was to predict whether or not it will rain the next day.
My approach: I started with the idea that location would be key to a good model and I tried two approaches, one based on average rainfall patterns for the time of year and the other based on a dayâ€™s weather predicting the weather on the following day.</description>
