      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 4 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on rainy days in Australia. The aim was to use todayâ€™s weather data to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow.
My approach: In this post, I use a series of hierarchical models, where the location within Australia is one level and day within the location is the other.</description>
