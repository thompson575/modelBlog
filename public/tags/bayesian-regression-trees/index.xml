      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 5 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on Airbnb properties in New York City. The aim was to predict the price per night.
My approach: I analyse the data using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) fitted using the BART package.
Result: Even with over 300 potential predictors, the BART models fit remarkably quickly, although the default burn-in proved insufficient.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe fundamental idea that underpins all machine learning is that of the universal approximator, that is, a function that is so flexible that it can be used to model any dataset. Trees provide one way to construct such a flexible function.
The code below simulates a small regression problem that I will use to illustrate the discussion of Bayesian tree models.
