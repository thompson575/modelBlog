      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 3 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on superstore sales. The aim was to predict the profit on each sale in the test set.
My approach: I start with the model used in my non-Bayesian analysis of these data, which transformed the profit to the profit that would have been obtained had there not been a discount.</description>
