      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 2 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on wildlife strikes with aircraft. The aim was to predict whether or not the aircraft was damaged in the collision.
My approach: The database was created by the FAA from reports filed by pilots that are clearly incomplete. For my previous post, I spent the vast majority of the time cleaning the data and afterwards used a logistic regression model.</description>

      <description>IntroductionProbabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) provide a way of specifying a Bayesian model and a choice of samplers that can be used to simulate parameter values from the modelâ€™s joint posterior. The Wikipedia page on Probabilitic Programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming) lists about 40 such languages, of which a handful can be run in, or via, R.
As the name suggests, BUGS (Bayesian Inference using Gibbs Sampling) is a PPL that uses Gibbs sampling.</description>
