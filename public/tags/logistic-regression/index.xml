      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 2 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on wildlife strikes with aircraft. The aim was to predict whether or not the aircraft was damaged in the collision.
My approach: The database was created by the FAA from reports filed by pilots that are clearly incomplete. For my previous post, I spent the vast majority of the time cleaning the data and afterwards used a logistic regression model.</description>

      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 4 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on daily weather patterns in different parts of Australia. The aim was to predict whether or not it will rain the next day.
My approach: I started with the idea that location would be key to a good model and I tried two approaches, one based on average rainfall patterns for the time of year and the other based on a dayâ€™s weather predicting the weather on the following day.</description>
