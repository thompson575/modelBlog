      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 5 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on Airbnb properties in New York City. The aim was to predict the price per night.
My approach: I work on a log(price + 1) scale as suggested by the evaluation metric. I spend quite a lot of time on feature extraction. I extract keywords from the description of the property and I merge geographically close neighbourhoods with few properties.</description>
