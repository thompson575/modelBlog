      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the games’ ratings.
My approach: I transformed the ratings and then explored the data by plotting the transformed ratings against the potential predictors. In the process, I identified a few unusual observations. The mechanics of the game and the type of game were described as text, so I extracted indicator variables for the keywords most associated with the game’s rating.</description>
