      <description>IntroductionMy last methods post described how Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) such as BUGS, nimble, stan and greta can be used to fit Bayesian models in R. These PPLs all use MCMC simulation, but they return their results in differently structured R objects, so I also gave the code of functions that take these objects and convert them into a standard tibble with one column for each parameter and one row for each iteration.</description>
