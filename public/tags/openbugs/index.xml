      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the games’ ratings.
My approach: In an earlier post entitled Sliced Episode 1: Boardgame Ratings, I analysed these data using traditional methods. That post describes my data cleaning, feature selection and data exploration. In this analysis, I take those same cleaned data and analyse them using a Bayesian model.</description>

      <description>IntroductionProbabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) provide a way of specifying a Bayesian model and a choice of samplers that can be used to simulate parameter values from the model’s joint posterior. The Wikipedia page on Probabilitic Programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming) lists about 40 such languages, of which a handful can be run in, or via, R.
As the name suggests, BUGS (Bayesian Inference using Gibbs Sampling) is a PPL that uses Gibbs sampling.</description>
