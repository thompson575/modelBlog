      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 8 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on tracks available on Spotify. The aim was to predict the track popularity.
My approach: I merged the data on the tracks with data on the artists and then identified genres that were associated with the track popularity. Using all available information, I fitted a random forest model using default values of the hyperparameters.</description>
