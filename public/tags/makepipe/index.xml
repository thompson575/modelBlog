      <description>Workflow managementMakefiles are a way of controlling large programming projects. Complex software is typically organised into multiple files of code. Each file requires compilation before the object files are linked together with pre-compiled libraries to create the final executable. When a change is made to one section of the code, it is important to recompile everything affected by that change, but not the code files that are unaffected. A makefile contains a list of all of the code files and libraries together with a set of rules that determine when re-compilation will be needed.</description>

      <description>Workflow ChangesI like to preach the importance of having a consistent workflow across all of oneâ€™s data analysis projects. Consistency is both more efficient and it helps reduce errors. Yet, nothing can exist without change and despite my wish for consistency, my workflow is constantly evolving. Sometimes it changes for good reason, sometimes for experimentation and sometimes because I just get bored with the old way.
My plan for this post is to discuss some of the recent changes in the way that I organise my data analysis projects.</description>
