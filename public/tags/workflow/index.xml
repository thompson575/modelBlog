      <description>Workflow managementMakefiles are a way of controlling large programming projects. Complex software is typically organised into multiple files of code. Each file requires compilation before the object files are linked together with pre-compiled libraries to create the final executable. When a change is made to one section of the code, it is important to recompile everything affected by that change, but not the code files that are unaffected. A makefile contains a list of all of the code files and libraries together with a set of rules that determine when re-compilation will be needed.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis post describes how I used the targets package to help create my blog post on the Bayesian analysis of the superstore profit data. It should be read alongside that post and together with my methods post on targets.
The Bayesian analysis of the superstore profits is just complex enough to provide a vehicle for discussing the benefits of targets.
Folder StructureFirst, I created a folder with the structure discussed in my methods post.</description>
