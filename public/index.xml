      <title>Sliced Episode 3: Superstore profits</title>

      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 3 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on superstore sales. The aim was to predict the profit on a sale.
My approach: This is a good example of a problem for which we have knowledge about the structure of the data. In particular, we know the relation between sales, cost, discount and profit.</description>

      <description>IntroductionWhen analysing the Sliced datasets I have tried to use a consistent approach in order that my code is easier to follow. In this post I will give an overview of my approach.
Naming of partsThe first thing that you will notice about my code is that all tibbles and data frames are given names that end in DF. Sorry if you don’t like it, but I find it helpful to distinguish the data frame names for the names of variables that sit within the data frame.</description>

      <title>Sliced Episode 2: Wildlife Strikes</title>

      <description>Summary:Background: In episode 2 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours in which to analyse a set of data on wildlife strikes with aircraft. The aim was to predict whether or not the aircraft was damaged in the collision.
My approach: The original database was created by the FAA from reports filed by pilots and reporting is clearly incomplete. I spent the vast majority of my time cleaning the data and afterwards used a logistic regression model.</description>

      <title>Sliced Episode 1: Boardgame Ratings</title>

      <description>SummaryBackground: In episode 1 of the 2021 series of Sliced, the competitors were given two hours to analyse a set of data on boardgames. The aim was to predict the games’ ratings.
My approach: In the data exploration I transform the ratings and plot them against the potential predictors. I note inconsistencies in the data. The mechanics of the game and the type of game are described as text, so I create indicator variables for the words most closely associated with the games’ ratings.</description>

      <description>This blog is written by John Thompson
email: john.thompson@leicester.ac.uk
I am now retired, but for many years I was a Biostatistician and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at the University of Leicester in England. Towards the end of my career I became interested in the relationship between statistical analysis and machine learning and this blog is my way of continuing that interest.
 The author on a good day.   </description>
