I am now retired, but for many years I was a Biostatistician and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at the University of Leicester in England. Towards the end of my career I became interested in the relationship between statistical analysis and machine learning and this blog is my way of continuing that interest.  

I started by analysing data from the twelve episodes of *Sliced 2021* , initially using conventional machine learning techniques in R and later using Bayesian models in R. In between the data analyses I post on statistical/machine learning methods implemented in R.

At present I am investigating the use of neural networks in data analysis with small to moderate sized datasets. More flexible modelling than deep learning.
