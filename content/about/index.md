I am now retired, but for many years I was a Biostatistician and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at the University of Leicester in England. Towards the end of my career I became interested in the relationship between statistical analysis and machine learning and this blog is my way of continuing that interest.  

I have analysed data from the twelve episodes of *Sliced 2021* and I am release the posts every week or so. After that I will work through the twelve episodes again but this time I will analyse the data using Bayesian models.  

These posts offer me an incentive for learning new skills and there are two further series that I plan, both dealing with topics about which I know a little. but not as much as I would like. I hope to analyse these same data using *Julia* and then using neural nets. By then it will probably time for *Sliced 2022*.
