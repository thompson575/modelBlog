<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When analysing the <em>Sliced</em> datasets I have tried to use a consistent approach in order that my code is easier to follow. In this post I will give an overview of my approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="naming-of-parts" class="section level1">
<h1>Naming of parts</h1>
<p>The first thing that you will notice about my code is that all tibbles and data frames are given names that end in <code>DF</code>. Sorry if you don’t like it, but I find it helpful to distinguish the data frame names for the names of variables that sit within the data frame. You will see names like trainDF and testDF.</p>
<p>Variables including columns within a data frame and independent objects are given names in lowerCaseCamel format, such as dateOfBirth, ageAtDiagnosis.</p>
<p>Functions and files are given names in lower_case_snake format. I try to make function names verb-like so that they describe the task performed by the function, file names are more likely to be noun-like. Examples are, plot_damage(), calculate_summary(), processed_data.csv.</p>
<p>In each episode of <code>Sliced</code> we are given three files</p>
<ul>
<li><code>train.csv</code> the data to be used to create the model<br />
</li>
<li><code>test.csv</code> the data used to evaluate performance<br />
</li>
<li><code>submission.csv</code> an example of the format of a submission</li>
</ul>
<p>When I read and process these files I try to use consistent names for my data frames data across all episodes.</p>
<p>It is my practice to read the <em>Sliced</em> data files and immediately save them as <code>train.rds</code>, <code>test.rds</code> and <code>submission.rds</code>. Even though I have never found need to use <code>submission.rds</code></p>
<p>Then I create the following data frames</p>
<p><code>trainRawDF</code> … the training data as read from <code>train.rds</code><br />
<code>testRawDF</code> … the test data as read from <code>test.rds</code></p>
<p><code>trainRawDF</code> usually goes through cleaning to produce a dataset that is used for training the model, I call the result of preprocessing, <code>trainDF</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the <code>trainDF</code> is randomly split into a set for model fitting and a validation set. I refer to these as the estimation dataset, <code>estimateDF</code>, and the validation dataset, <code>validateDF</code>.</p>
<p>If the pre-processing involves several stages, the intermediate datasets between <code>trainRawDF</code> and <code>trainDF</code>, I like to collect the stages together in a function such as <code>preprocess()</code> so that I can apply exactly the same process to the training and test data.</p>
</div>
<div id="file-structure" class="section level1">
<h1>File structure</h1>
<p>The data from each <em>Sliced</em> episode is analysed in a different folder named after the episode, s01-e01, s01-e02 etc. So in the setup section of my code you will see that I define the home directory, say,</p>
<p>home &lt;- “C:/Projects/sliced/s01-e02”</p>
<p>Within the home folder, I create subfolders called</p>
<p><code>data</code> … to hold data<br />
<code>docs</code> … to hold any documents related to the analysis<br />
<code>R</code> … R scripts<br />
<code>rmd</code> … rmarkdown files<br />
<code>temp</code> … any temporary files</p>
<p>within data I have three folders</p>
<p><code>dataStore</code> … files of results<br />
<code>rawData</code> … the original csv files<br />
<code>rData</code> … R formatted files .rda or .rds</p>
<p>I also have a standard subfolder structure within docs and archive subfolders within R and rmd, but for <em>Sliced</em> I have not needed to use them.</p>
<p>Although many of the subfolders do not get used for <em>Sliced</em>, this is the structure that I use for every data analysis and so I have kept it. I have a function that creates these folders and I run it at the start of every project, <em>Sliced</em> or otherwise.</p>
