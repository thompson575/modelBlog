Websites that I find useful

r-bloggers  https://www.r-bloggers.com/ the best way to discover what is going on in the R community.  

nibble https://r-nimble.org/ Bayesian computation in R. Greatly improved by the recent addition of HMC sampling.  

mlr3 https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/ organise your machine learning workflows. A competitor for tidymodels that is harder to use but more transparent.  

targets https://github.com/ropensci/targets very comprehensive package for reproducible workflows in R. I like makepipe https://kinto-b.github.io/makepipe/ , a simpler alternative.

The Elements of Statistical Learning https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/. By far my favourite book on machine learning. The site includes a pdf download.
